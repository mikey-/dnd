      4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your
      spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level.
      On a successful check, the spell ends.
    At Higher Levels:
      When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher,
      you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s
      level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used
  - Water Walk:
    Level: 3rd-level
    Type: transmutation (ritual)
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 30 feet
    Components: V, S, M (a piece of cork)
    Duration: 1 hour
    Description:
      This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as
      water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid
      ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the
      heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this
      ability for the duration. If you target a creature submerged in a liquid,
      the spell carries the target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60
      feet per round.
  - Dominate Beast:
    Level: 4th-level
    Type: Enchantment
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 60 feet
    Components: V, S
    Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
    Description:
      You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range.
      It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charm ed by you for the
      duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it,
      it has advantage on the saving throw. While the beast is charmed, you
      have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same
      plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands
      to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it
      does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of
      action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that
      object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further
      direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its
      ability.
      You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
      Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you
      choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During
      this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this
      requires you to use your own reaction as well. Each time the target takes
      damage, it makes a new W isdom saving throw against the spell. If the
      saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.
    At Higher Levels:
      5th-level: the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes.
      6th-level: spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1 hour.
      7th-level or higher: the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

  - Banishment:
    Level: 4th-level
    Type: abjuration
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 60 feet
    Components: V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)
    Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
    Description:
      You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another
      plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or
      be banished. If the target is native to the plane of existence you’re on,
      you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is
      incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which
      point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
      unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target is native to a
      different plane of existence than the one you’re on, the target is
      banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the
      spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space
      it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
      Otherwise, the target doesn't return.
    At Higher Levels:
      When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you
      can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.

  - Grasping Vine:
    Level: 4th-level
    Type: Conjuration
    Casting Time: 1 bonus action
    Range: 30 feet
    Components: V, S
    Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
    Description:
      You conjure a vine that sprouts from the ground in an unoccupied space
      of your choice that you can see within range. When you cast this spell,
      you can direct the vine to lash out at a creature within 30 feet of it
      that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
      or be pulled 20 feet directly toward the vine.
      Until the spell ends, you can direct the vine to lash out at the same
      creature or another one as a bonus action on each of your turns.
