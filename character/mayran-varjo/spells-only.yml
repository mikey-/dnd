    Type: Necromancy
    Casting Time: 1 minute
    Range: 10 feet
    Components: V, S, M (drop of blood, piece of flesh, and pinch of bone dust)
    Duration: Instantaneous
    Description:
      This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse
      of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target
      with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target
      becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse
      (the DM has the creature’s game statistics). On each of your turns, you
      can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this
      spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple
      creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing
      the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will
      take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a
      general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.
      If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile
      creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until
      its task is complete.
      The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops
      obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature
      for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again
      before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts
      your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell,
      rather than animating a new one.
    At Higher Levels:
        4th level or higher:
          You animate or reassert control over two additional undead creatures
          for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a
          different corpse or pile of bones.

    Description:
      The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others
      to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within
      your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain
      hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Until the
      spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an
      action.
    At Higher Levels:
      4th level  or higher: +1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

    Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
    Description:
      You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance
      of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral
      form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear
      fiendish. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of
      creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s
      speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the
      first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom
      saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage. On
      a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
    At Higher Levels:
      4th level or higher: +1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

  - Feign Death:
    Level: 3rd
    Type: Necromancy (ritual)
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: Touch
    Components: V, S, M (a pinch of graveyard dirt)
    Duration: 1 hour
    Description:
      You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is
      indistinguishable from death. For the spell’s duration, or until you use
      an action to touch the target and dismiss the spell, the target appears
      dead to all outward inspection and to spells used to determine the
      target’s status. The target is blinded and incapacitated, and its speed
      drops to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage.
      If the target is diseased or poisoned when you cast the spell, or becomes
      diseased or poisoned while under the spell’s effect, the disease and
      poison have no effect until the spell ends.

  - SpeakwithDead:
    Level: 3
    Type: Necromancy
    Casting Time: 1 action
    Range: 10 feet
    Components: V, S, M (burning incense)
    Duration: 10 minutes
    Description:
      You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your
      choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The
      corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the
      corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days. Until the
      spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows
      only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are
      usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no
      compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it
      recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul
      to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new
      information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died,
      and can’t speculate about future events.
