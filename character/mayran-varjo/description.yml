    coloured scales appear to be cracking, as if they were actually rusted metal
    This condition in his appearence is caused by self-flagellation
  Insignia of rank:
    - Type: Low - medium level rank
    - Description: Neck tattoo of a bleeding hand holding a whip

  Background:
    Diety: Loviatar (Godess of Pain)
    Adventuring becuase:
      The Disciples of the White Rod and Loviatan terä are no more, two entire
      orders of clergy annihilated defending their most sacred and powerful
      artifact, The White Rod! The ultimate device of agonyyyyyyyyy!
      A devestating weapon, known to cause mass necrosis to all living things
      near it.
      (; Especially forests! ;)
      As the last of the Loviatan terä, Loviatar's Blade, I must find the Rod
      and punnish the thieves!!!!! LET THE PAAIIN SPEAK TO ME!

    Military Background:
      Loviatan terä (Loviatar's Blade) is the Loviatan's militant oder of
      War and Death Clerics. They're all about punnishment of Loviatar's enimies
      with discipline and love to prove their strength of spirit. My military
      rank was scout.

    More Notes:
      From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loviatar_(Forgotten_Realms)
      Clergy: Disciples of the White Rod
      Activities: Loviatans often engage in self-flagellation, often in the
      morning when praying for spells. They celebrate each season with the
      Rite of Pain and Purity, a ritual that involves followers dancing on
      glass, thorns or barbed-wire while being whipped by higher-level
      Loviatans. A smaller ritual occurring every twelve days involves follower
      passing their bodies through the flames of candles

    Potential Bonds:
      - Maybe I saved the life of a superious during the battle for The White
      Rod which is a huge dishonour. Loviatar despises those who help others.
      - Open up about the battle
      - ????
