Class Features:
  Reaper:
    When the cleric casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one
    creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and 5 feet
    of each other.

  Channel Divinity:
    At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from
    your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two
    such effects, Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some
    domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted
    in the domain description.
    When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You
    must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
    Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an
    effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC. Beginning
    at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and
    beginning at 18th level, u can use it three times between rests. When you
    finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

  Class Channel Divinity:
    Name: Turn Undead
    Usage: Once per short or long rest
    Description:
      As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring
      the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
      must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw,
      it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature
      must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it
      can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
      It also can’t take reactions! For its action, it can use only the Dash
      action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
      If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

    At Higher Levels:
      5th Level:
        when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature,
        the creature is instantly destroyed if it's challenge rating is at or
        below
            Cleric Level 5: 1/2 or lower
            Cleric Level 8: 1 or lower
            Cleric Level 11: 2 or lower
            Cleric Level 14: 3 or lower
            Cleric Level 17: 4 or lower

    Divine Domain Channel Divinity:
      Name: Touch of Death
      Usage: Once per
      Starting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to destroy
      another creatures life force by touch. When the cleric hits a creature
      with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra
      necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice their cleric
      level
