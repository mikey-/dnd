        in any dimension, you mend it. leaving no trace of the former damage.

  - Race Catnip:
    - Minor Illusion:
      Type: Illusion cantrip
      Casting Time: 1 action
      Range: 30 feet
      Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
      Duration: 1 minute
      Description:
        You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for
        the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or
        cast this spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from
        a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice,
        a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The
        sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make
        discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. If you create
        an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small
        chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create
        sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction
        with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass
        through it. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image,
        the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
        Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
        creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes
        faint to the creature.
