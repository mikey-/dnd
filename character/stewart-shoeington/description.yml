  Background:
    Story:
      "Stewart Shoeington or 'Stewie Shoey' as he's known by a few, is a slave
      warden of Tuomitun Tuhoutuminen (the desolation of the convicted) Desert,
      beyond the marshland wastes of Suolla (swamp ass), which border the grand
      gates of Maaginen Uhkapeli (Mage's Gamble), a corrupt city of untold
      magical wonder for very few and deadly wizardly rivalry for all.

      Lu E. Shoeington, Stewie's mother, came to Maaginen Uhkapeli with high
      hopes of slurping down tomes of ancient arcane knowledge and becoming a
      magical GOD. Though she was skilled, this is Maaginen Uhkapeli, baby!
      A giant city teeming with wizards and arcane scholars, all super horny for
      power. It's named 'The Mage's Gamble' for a reason, bb. In this city, ya
      don't just make it by being 'good' and 'super magical' haha, oh hoooo, no
      way!! You make it by ruthlessly sentencing your rivals to DEATH BY
      ASSASSINATION. If you needed someone to dissapear, the dark association
      of assassins named The Thuggish Ruggish Bone were always at your service

      Since Lu E. wasn't the best and never wanted to murder anyone, she never
      made her mark and she never made a cent. In defience of the corruption
      and injustices within the city she started offering her services in
      abjuration.

      While his mother was busy ~saving the city~, Stewie spent his early
      childhood on the streets, begging and carrying out odd jobs for local
      Wizards. Stewie hated wizards and how they'd turn their noses up at him
      and lil' snitch ass mama. To the wizards, Lu E. was weak and though maybe
      some of them secretly respected her talents in abjuration, she was a pest.
      Some wizards would even take out their frustrations on Stewie when he
      made mistakes, scaring him with illusions or even polymorphing him if he
      made a small mistakes. He hated serving them and would often steal little
      magical bits and pieces from them.

      The theivery drew attention Stewie as a sneak and it wasn't long until
      The Thuggish Ruggish Bone were on his trail, looking for a new recruit.
      It was known to very few that The Thuggish Ruggish Bone would train
      children to perform their assassinations. Lu E would dread the day
      she ever set foot in Maaginen Uhkapeli the day Stewie went missing. They
      never saw each other again and poor lil Stewie would never be the same
      again.

      By his fifth assassination, he actually enjoyed killing wizards, even
      though he knew it was always just helping another wizard rise to power.
      Over the next four years, he became an accomplished assassin. He never
      looked for his mother and she never stopped looking for him.

      Stewie was eventually caught during an assassination attempt and jailed
      for a short time before being sentenced to walk the Tuomitun Tuhoutuminen
      for the rest of his life. As a slave warden he is magically bound to
      serving as the first line of defence of the city he hates so much, from
      the beasts and raiding hordes that threaten Maaginen Uhkapeli.
