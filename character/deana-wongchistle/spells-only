      Range: 30 feet
      Components: V
      Duration: Up to 1 minute

            1 minute.
          - You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.
          - You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of
            your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of a
            raven, or ominous whispers.
          - You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or win­ dow to fly open
            or slam shut.
          - You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.
      multiple casts:
        you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active
        at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

  - Sorcerer Catnips:
    - Chill Touch:
      Type: Necromancy
      Casting Time: 1 action
      Range: 120 feet
      Components: V, S
      Duration: 1 round
      Description:
        You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within
        range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it
        with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic
        damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next
        turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead
        target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the
        end of your next turn.
      Higher Levels:
        This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),
        11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

    - Fire Bolt:
      Type: Evocation
      Casting Time: 1 action
      Range: 120 feet
      Components: V, S
      Duration: Instantaneous
      Description:
        You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a
        ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10
        fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't
        being worn or carried. This spell’s damage increases by 1d10 when you
        reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

    - Friends:
        Type: Enchantment
        Casting Time: 1 action
        Range: Self
        Components: S, M (a small amount of makeup applied to the face as this spell is cast)
        Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
        Description:
          For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed
          at one creature of your choice that isn’t hostile toward you. When
          the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to
          influence its mood and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone
          to violence might attack you. Another creature might seek retribution
          in other ways (at the DM’s discretion), depending on the nature of
          your interaction with it.

    - Message:
      Type: Transmutation

      Duration: 1 round
      Description:
        You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a
        message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can
        reply in a whisper that only you can hear. You can cast this spell
        through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it
        is beyond the barrier. Magical silence. 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
        common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell.
        The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely
        around corners or through openings.
