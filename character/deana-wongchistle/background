Deana Wongchistle, descendant of ____, of the Toril Thirteen,
Comes from a loooooong line of warlocks.
____ tricked Asmodeus, King of the Nine Hells into also infusing his rods
essence into their bloodline
This has said to have had no effect to their bloodline for centuries...
Until now

Deana has never known her family and Monster Hunting/Adventuring is the only
life she's ever known. Her foster mother, a warlock Monster Hunter named
Frank, would take Deana on all of her hunts.
Tragically, Frank was brutally murdered by a Demonic Warrior Spirit named
Pro Genji; the words "The dragon becomes me!" were slashed across Franks
chest and stomach.

Deana knows that some day she'll face Pro Genji and either avenge Frank... or
DIE!!!!!!
