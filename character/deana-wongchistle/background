Deana Wongchistle, descendant of ____, of the Toril Thirteen,
Comes from a loooooong line of warlocks.
____ tricked Asmodeus, King of the Nine Hells into also infusing his rods

This has said to have had no effect to their bloodline for centuries...
Until now

Deana knows that some day she'll face Pro Genji and either avenge Frank... or
DIE!!!!!!
